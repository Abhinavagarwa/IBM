                        Working with the advertising and tech industries, the UN’s ActNow campaign was launched at COP 24 in December 2018 and has since expanded from a Facebook Messenger bot to an interactive gamified app that helps individuals calculate their sustainable and environmental footprint. Partnerships and collaborations include major movies such as Angry Birds, Smurfs and Trolls movies; as well as world renowned chefs and fashion designers to help spur behaviour change. In 2022, the UN collaborated with the messaging service WhatsApp to reach millions of more users to encourage them to take simple actions to help protect our planet. You can find the website in six languages.</p>
